  <h2> High Rates of Obesity Among the Food Insecure</h2>
  <h3> By: Jenna Bagcal </h3>

  <div>

    <p> In the five boroughs, there were 1.36 million individuals who were self-reported as "food insecure" in 2013, according to <a href="http://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/our-research/map-the-meal-gap/2013/map-the-meal-gap-2013-exec-summ.pdf"> feedingamerica.org. </a> In 2006, the USDA created ranges of food security and food insecurity based on certain criteria. Food secure individuals can have high food security, meaning they have no problems with food access or limits, or marginal food security - one or two instances of problems with food access and limits. </p>

    <p> Food insecure indivuals have either low food security or very low food security. Individuals with low food security have reduced quality, variety or desirability of diet, while those with very low food security have the added qualification of disrupted eating patterns and reduced food intake. </p>

    <p> But residents in these food inescure neighborhoods also have high rates of obesity. The highest rates of food insecurity are in parts of Brooklyn and the Bronx.</p>

    <p> The chart below depicts how these food insecure neighborhoods also have populations with high rates of obesity. </p>

    <p> According to data from the New York State Department of Health, (NYSDOA) the Bronx has the highest rate of obesity in the five boroughs, while the lowest is in Manhattan. The Bronx has 31 percent obesity among its population, which is above the New York State percentage of 24.5 percent. In Manhattan, the percentage of obese adults is below the state average, at 16.8 percent. </p>

    <p> The data also showed that non-Hispanic Blacks have 32.5 percent in New York. Other groups who have high obesity rates are those who have less than $25,000 annual income and individuals with disabilities. </p>

     <p> The data from <a href="http://www.data2go.nyc/map/?id=316*36047015900*food_insecure_cd!undefined!undefined*!other_pop_puma_506~ahdi_puma_1~sch_enrol_puma_112~age_pyramid_male_85_plus_puma_20~median_household_income_puma_397~median_personal_earnings_puma_400~dis_y_perc_puma_102~poverty_ceo_puma_417~unemployment_puma_408~pre_k_puma_107!*air_qual_cd~ahdi_puma*family_homeless_cd_245#"> data2go.nyc </a> shows that the community districts with the highest food insecurity have mostly Black or Latino populations, lower median incomes and lower education.</p>
